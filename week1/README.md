And he was enjoying his rest and writing memoirs. But suddenly he received a letter from Gandalf. He had hidden a golden key somewhere in the village and he can't name the place because of many enemies. But he left Frodo some clues!  
So, after a glass of beer Frodo decided to prepare for his trip to Gendalf, it's winter, Frodo needs a hat, a coat and he needs a bag for his stuff and food.
